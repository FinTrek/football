**-- DATAASET --**

In the paper submitted to CIKM 2019, we inform that the dataset can be reconstructed from our code. However, *sportmonks.com* allows us to make the dataset available if the data is not used for commercial purposes. Thus, in addition to our code, we are making the preprocessed dataset available at:

**-- MODELS --**

folder: cikm/[model]/bestparams: The best parameters of each model.

folder: cikm/[model]/tunning: Partial results of validation

**-- CODE --**

We are doing a refactoring in our code. The version used for CIKM is in the folder */old*. The new version of the software is being deployed on root.

**-- TUTORIAL --**

Soon we will provide a guide to reproduce the experiments of paper.
